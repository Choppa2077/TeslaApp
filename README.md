# Getting Started

Hello! This is my first React Native application.And i happy to share it with peoples.In this simple project I build Tesla site like a mobile application and I used 4 components it is a CarItem, CarList, StyledButton, Header.We have a simple header with a logo and hamburger menu png. And in CarList component I used FlatList and mapped a CarItem component and used data from cars.js file when I have a rray of objects.And people can scroll ,my FlatList have a snap effect like in a all modern applications like Tiktok, and Reels on Instagram for example. And also each CarItem have title and subtitle and image for all width of devices like a background. And above we have a custom button from StyledButton component and for this component i gived a props.

And that's all.My first simple React Native App.
